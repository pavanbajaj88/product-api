 API communicate with an Amazon DynamoDB NoSQL database.
 
 Things I did -
 AWS account with a DynamoDB
 API handles POST - For Posting product information and GET retrieving all items.
 
 Things I would've done
 Had some authentication, checking whether a user could add a product.
 Written, hopefully, prettier code, separating model and database access methods.
 Implemented unit tests.
 Used interfaces more often.
 Implement a caching layer.
 Add more fields to the products table such as product description or keywords to allow search terms not included in the Title to still match relevant products.
